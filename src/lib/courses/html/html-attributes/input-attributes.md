In HTML, the `<input>` tag is used to create an input field where users can enter data. It's often used in forms to collect information like usernames, passwords, and email addresses.

An input element can have many attributes that define its properties and behaviors. Here's an extensive list of common input attributes.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | text, password, submit, radio, checkbox, number, date, etc. | Defines the type of the input control. |
| `value` | Text | Defines the initial (default) value of the input control. |
| `name` | Text | Defines the name for the input control. |
| `disabled` | disabled | Disables the input control. The control won't accept changes from the user. |
| `readonly` | readonly | Makes the input control read-only. The user can't modify the input, but can still focus and select it. |
| `size` | Number | Specifies the width of the input in characters. |
| `maxlength` | Number | Defines the maximum number of characters the user can enter into the input. |
| `min` | Number or date | Defines the minimum value for an input field. |
| `max` | Number or date | Defines the maximum value for an input field. |
| `pattern` | Regular expression | Defines a regular expression that the input field's value is checked against. |
| `required` | No value (no =) | Indicates that the user must fill in a value before submitting a form. |
| `placeholder` | Text | Provides a hint that describes the expected value of an input field. |
| `autocomplete` | on, off | Indicates whether input fields should have autocomplete functionality. |
| `autofocus` | autofocus | Specifies that an input field should automatically get focus when the page loads. |

Here's an example of an input elements with several attributes:

:::renderer
```html
<input type="text" name="username" value="JohnDoe" size="20" placeholder="Enter your username" />
<input type="password" name="password" value="password" size="20" placeholder="Enter your password" />
<input type="checkbox" name="remember" checked /> Remember me
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
```
:::

:::note
- The `type` attribute is set to `text` to create a text box.
- The `name` attribute is set to "username" to give the input a name.
- The `value` attribute is set to "JohnDoe" to set the initial value of the input.
- The `size` attribute is set to 20 to set the width of the input to 20 characters.
- The `placeholder` attribute is set to "Enter your username" to provide a hint to the user (this is only visible when the input is empty).

:::warning
Keep in mind that some attributes are specific to certain input types. For example, the `min` and `max` attributes are applicable for `number`, `range`, `date`, `datetime-local`, `month`, `time`, and `week` input types.
